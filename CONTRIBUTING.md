Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before
maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST describe tests you've done.

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description
which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Thank you!
